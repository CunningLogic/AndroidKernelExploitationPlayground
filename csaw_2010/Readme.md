CSAW CTF 2010 Kernel Exploitation Challenge
==========================================

The finals for NYU Polyâ€™s CSAW CTF was this past weekend in New York City.  I thought I would post the kernel exploitation challenge I developed for the final round.  Feel free to try your hand at solving it!

The Setup
========
Each team is given unprivileged remote shell access to a Linux VM.  There is a vulnerable kernel module (csaw.ko) loaded into memory:

```
csaw@csaw ~ $ lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
csaw                    1111  0
```
`
The kernel module exposes a /proc/csaw interface with which the team can interact with and attempt to exploit the vulnerability contained in the kernel module.  Upon successful exploitation and privilege escalation, the team can retrieve the key/flag hidden in the root-readable /root/key.txt file.

The full source code of the csaw.ko kernel module is provided to the team so that they can discover and subsequently exploit the vulnerability.  The csaw.c can be downloaded [here](http://jon.oberheide.org/files/csaw.c)
